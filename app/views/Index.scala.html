            <p>The first web browser was invented in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee. It was called <a
            href="http://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/">WorldWideWeb</a> (no spaces) and was later
                renamed
                Nexus. In 1993, Marc Andreesen created a browser that was easy to use and install with the release of Mosaic
                (later
                Netscape), "the world's first popular browser", which made the World Wide Web system easy to use and more
                accessible
                to the average person. Andreesen's browser sparked the internet boom of the 1990s. These are the two major
                milestones
                in the history of the Web.</p>

            <p>The wars put the Web in the hands of millions of ordinary PC users, but showed how commercialization of the Web
                could
                stymie standards efforts. Both Microsoft and Netscape liberally incorporated proprietary extensions to HTML in
                their
                products, and tried to gain an edge by product differentiation, leading to the acceptance of the Cascading Style
                Sheets proposed by Hakon Wium Lie over Netscape's JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS) by W3C.</p>
