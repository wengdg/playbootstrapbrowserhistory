            <p>Google's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a>
                opposed the development of an
                independent web browser for six years. He stated that "at the time, Google was a small company," and he did not
                want
                to go through "bruising browser wars." After co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired several Mozilla Firefox
                developers and built a demonstration of Chrome, however, Schmidt admitted that "It was so good that it essentially
                forced me to change my mind."</p>

            <p>In December 2010 Google announced that to make it easier for businesses to use Chrome they would provide an
                official
                Chrome MSI package. For business use it is helpful to have full-fledged MSI packages that can be customized via
                transform files (.mst) - but the MSI provided with Chrome is only a very limited MSI wrapper fitted around the
                normal
                installer, and many businesses find that this arrangement does not meet their needs.</p>
